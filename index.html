        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
          For the third and final project of CS 491 AR/VR at UIC, my goal is to build a unified workspace
          that I am calling Collaborate.  The idea of the project is that I have worked in many offices 
          through internships.  In each internship I have been at, I have seen one common problem: 
          collaboration.  When working with a new company, as an intern, you are bound to have questions 
          and will need assistance regardless of how independent of a programmer you are.  Most companies 
          use Slack or some other chat service that is company wide.  As that is great and all, once 
          you get the attention of the person you are trying to work with, they come over and try and 
          help.  Then the person has to look through your code with you behind the laptop.  The person 
          trying to help does not have much control of what happens and s/he just tell's you to scroll 
          up or down or look for certain things that could be the cause.  This causes a lot of time 
          to be lost on both sides; you lose time and the s/he loses time.  Here is where Collaborate 
          comes in to help.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
          Collaborate is going to be using augmented reality technology with the Hololens.  The reason for that is 
          that in an office space, even when you are wired in, you should still be able to see your 
          surroundings and be aware of what is happening around you.  With the Hololens, as a user, 
          one can look around the room and still see all of his/her coworkers.  The virtual reality experience 
          would not be as good because your vision is blocked. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
          Collaborate would be used in a method that expediates the process of helping one another in an 
          office while also respecting the time of both parties.  Using Hololens provided by Microsoft, I 
          plan to create an office space where everyone is in a Hololens (yes, I am aware that that would 
          be one expensive endeavour) and they can interact with one another through the Hololens.  So, 
          as a company, I would have everyone in Hololens, with everyone having their own virtual desktop 
          that they can work with.  Each desk would have a Hololens, a mouse, and a keyboard.  That 
          reduces the need for having to carry around laptops or having desktops at each station, it 
          reduces the need for a presenter at a meeting to bring their laptop or bring their presentation on 
          a flashdrive or through email.  This allows your virtual workstation to be a transportable area 
          of work with ease.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
          Collaborate allows ever user to have their own workspace that they can choose how many monitors 
          to have, what windows to show, what to hide, have some cool knicknacks on their desk.  Collaborate 
          is to help unclutter the workspace and make it more futureistic.  As of now, the current idea 
          is to only have a mouse and keybord on every desk because it is currently difficult to emulate 
          a keyboard when it is not physical.  Whether a mouse is needed or not, is up to the user; the 
          user can use voice or touch controls or use a physical mouse.  From that, a user can ask for help 
          from a fellow colleague.  Lets say that I ask for help from my coworker.  From this point, my 
          colleague can move or copy my window to his workspace.  This would eliminate travel time as well 
          as make it easier to collaborate with one another.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
          There will be one main user who can create new users.  Each user will have their own workspace area.  
          Each workstation is owned by a user, I will probably implement a basic login system that will load 
          up a specific individual's workspace.  Each individual workspace is locked to that user, but a user 
          can share their workspace which will allow certain windows, in the workspace, to be able to be shared 
          with fellow coworkers.  Through that, it will allow people to collaborate from across the office!  
          The main focus of this feature is to allow a futureistic collaboritive mode to allow coworkers to 
          utilize each other in a more efficient way.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
          Collaborate will also allow for users to hide their workspaces to work in privacy.  Sometimes, HR 
          needs to work on compensation work and that needs to be done in private.  Having a feature to enable 
          users to work in privacy without having to worry about getting special screen reflectors or using special 
          software.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
          Collaborate will also allow users to move their workstations into meetings and have a more open desk 
          for people to work with.  There will also be a virtual keyboard if a user wants to not worry about 
          carrying around their physical keyboard.  I am currently not sure about the features of a virtual mouse, 
          but I would also allow for that to be used if a user wanted to use that.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
          The way that an office can manage their employees is that the office will all be a part of a virtual 
          achor that is created by a reference point with Hololens.  From there, as employees use their 
          Hololens, they can find the anchor that was set up by their office admin and log in with their account 
          to then see their virtual workspace.  As of now, the current development of it will allow for a 
          series of remote desktops to be run on the hololens.  So, based on that, the only OS that is going 
          to work natively would be Windows.

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
          For this project, I plan to use Microsoft's Hololens.  The reason, as stated in the description, 
          is that it allows for awareness of the environment.  With that being said, I will be using Unity 
          for my development tool because it is the most supported tool when comparing Unity and Unreal Engine.  
          Unity has a lot of awesome libraries that can be used with Hololens made by Microsoft as well as 
          various other people who seem to have extensive knowledge in augmented reality development, or at 
          least understand augmented reality to an extend of being able to create tools for it.  Some other 
          hardware that I will be using is a physical keyboard and a physical mouse.  Those two are because 
          it currently seems difficult to emulate a keyboard in a nice, augmented way.  Also, who doesn't 
          like the clickity clack of a physical keyboard.  The mouse is for a physical way of navigation rather 
          than an augmented way of navigation within the virtual office.  Aside from those, the main hardware 
          I will be using is a physical computer to run the program to run Collaborate.  In a perfect world, 
          I would have some powerhouse computer that can house hundreds of Hololens, but since we don't have 
          a super powerhouse computer or hundreds of Hololens headsets to test with, I will be using whatever 
          UIC's EVL has.

          My role will be to develop Collaborate.  I will be making the environment that users can work in as 
          well as any UI that is needed to be developed.

          I will start with creating a workspace that is easy to use and easy to navigate.  From there, I will 
          work on user experience and make sure that the application can be used by anybody that wants to 
          use it.  After that, I will be working on the centralized anchor to be able to share all the workspaces 
          in the same space.  *** MORE OF THIS WILL BE BROKEN DOWN AND SHOWN ON THE TRELLO BOARD
